:mage: Howdy, I’m Bill Wallis
---
I like Maths, coding, and Star Trek – Qapla'!

I'm a Data person, specialising in SQL and Python. A lot of my brain power is spent thinking about automation, optimisation, application structure, and data modelling.

I'm motivated by "how I do" rather than "what I do".

Some of my pet peeves include:
- Homonyms
- Ted Mosby
- Datetime formats that don't follow [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)
